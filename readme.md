# Sort Examples

## How to compile
make sure g++ is installed as well as Make

To build:
```
make
```

To clean:
```
make clean
```

## Bubble Sort
* Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
* Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n)
* Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Insertion Sort
* Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
* Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n)
* Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Selection Sort
* Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
* Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n2)
* Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Quick Sort
* Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n2)
* Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n*log n)
* Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n*log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n*log n)

## Merge Sort
* Worst Case Time Complexity [ Big-O ]: O(n*log n)
* Best Case Time Complexity [Big-omega]: O(n*log n)
* Average Time Complexity [Big-theta]: O(n*log n)
* Space Complexity: O(n)

[source](src/mergesort.c)

## Heap Sort
*Heap Sort is very fast and is widely used for sorting*
* Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n*log n)
* Best Case Time Complexity: O(n*log n)
* Average Time Complexity: O(n*log n)
* Space Complexity : O(1)
